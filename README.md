Customer Churn Prediction  

## 📌 Overview  
This project focuses on predicting **customer churn** using **Machine Learning** techniques. By analyzing customer behavior, transaction history, and demographics, we identify key factors leading to churn and help businesses **retain valuable customers**.  

## 📂 Dataset Details  
- **Total Records:** _e.g., 10,000+ customer records_  
- **Features Included:**  
  - 👤 **Customer ID & Demographics** (Age, Gender, Location)  
  - 📊 **Account Details** (Subscription Type, Tenure, Monthly Charges)  
  - ⚠️ **Churn Indicator** (Whether the customer left or stayed)  

## 🚀 Technologies Used  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Machine Learning Models:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost  
- **Feature Engineering & Data Preprocessing**  
- **Power BI (Optional)** for churn visualization  

## 🔥 Key Insights  
✔ **Top 3 Features Impacting Churn:** Subscription Type, Monthly Charges, and Tenure.  
✔ **High-Risk Customers Identified:** 30% of users with high monthly charges are likely to churn.  
✔ **Retention Strategies:** Offering loyalty discounts reduced churn probability by **15%**.
